# Super-Resolution

This is some of the research I have been conducting as part of my internship with RisosEnterprises Ltd(https://risosenterprises.com/) , a start-up company developing A revolutionary hand held technology to detect waterborne particulates. My primary area of responsibility is Super Resolution, and the research presented here focuses on developing novel techniques to enhance the resolution of low-resolution images.
